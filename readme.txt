Multilingual BuddyPress with Bogo

== Description ==

Make your multilingual WordPress site have a multilingual social network, with Bogo and BuddyPress.

Say your default language BuddyPress is located at `/members/` and you have German and Spanish translations of your website, then the localized BuddyPress versions can be viewed at `/de/members/` and `/es/members/` respectively.

Translate your BuddyPress Extended Profiles: Admin Panel -> Users -> BogoBP XProfile

All email notifications are localized to the language the user set in their profile. Also localizes URLs contained in emails where appropriate.

Known limitation: Parts of the activity stream are not localized. I haven't looked at the details and I'll probably not fix it. Let me know if you do and I'll apply your patch.

Development status: This plugin was developed because I thought it was a solution to my problem. It wasn't. Turns out what I really needed was a multisite setup with separate languages and BP_ENABLE_MULTIBLOG enabled. When I found out, I was close the version 3.0 release of Bogo BuddyPress, so I finished up and released it. Please understand that I am busy with other projects now, do not rely on my support or maintenance of this plugin. If you fix a bug and send me a patch, I will gladly apply it. If you pay good money and I've got some time, I might fix or add something for you. Other than that, you're on your own.
